<!-- FOO_Notes_from_book >>
    
    conditional statements and loops: two of the most valuable
tools for decision making. In order to make decisions in a computer language, we need to let
the program know what should happen in response to certain conditions, which is where con-
ditional statements come in. 

Loops, on the other hand, simply allow you to repeat an action
until a specified circumstance is met. For example, you might want to loop through each input
box in a form and check the information it contains is valid. -->

    Primitive DATA TYPES - store only SINGLE VALUES

 <!-- 2 More >> Primitive DATA TYPES
   
# Null: Indicates that there is no data.
# Undefined: Indicates that something has not been defined and given a value. This is
important when you’re working with variables. 

-->

<!-- 
## STRINGS are OK with SINGLE and DOUBLE Quotes 
# If we need SINGLE Quotes inside a STRING - then START and END String with DOUBLE Quotes
# The START and END Quotes are >> ***delimiter***
#
# # ESCAPE SEQUENCES - better than QUOTES 
\b Backspace.
\f Form feed.
\n Newline.
\r Carriage return.
\t Tab.
\' Single quote. >> ('STRING\'s with a single quote within') uses ESCAPE SEQUENCE \'
\" Double quote.
\\ Backslash. 

Here above - The escape sequence tells the JavaScript interpreter that the single quotation mark belongs to
the string itself and isn’t a ***delimiter***.
